# Creating a Github Portfolio

1. Create a repository named something like `coding-boot-camp`. Initialize it **with** a `README.md` file.

2. Clone the repository via its URL onto your local machine **outside** of your `UKED...` folder.

3. Copy/paste your project, homework, and in-class assignment files The `README.md` serves as documentation for the work you've done in the boot camp. A preferred format for this would be naming a folder according to the skill/language you learned (e.g., `Matplotlib`, `Social Analytics`, `Pandas`, etc.) and placing your homework with its respective code in that folder.

4. In your `README.md` file, for each homework, you can create a growing list of the name of the assignment with a [about:blank;](link) to its code, a description of the assignment, and what you learned. For example:

> ### Project: Academy of Py
> ##### Description: Using a CSV file from a city's school district, I analyzed students' standardized test scores and compared that to metadata about the schools' features (size, type, grades), showcasing trends in school performance. This data was used to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
> #### Skills: Pandas, Numpy

5. Moving forward, keep homeworks, exercises and assignments you work on in class in that folder, and by the end of the boot camp, you will have a well-stocked portfolio to present to employers.
